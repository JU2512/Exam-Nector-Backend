Longbuck is a Java library that eliminates boilerplate code to start choose a class and then start annotating. At Getter and At Setter will generate your default getters and setters. At NoArgs constructor and at all Args constructor will generate constructors with no parameters and all parameters. And the more granular required Args constructor generates one that only includes the fields that are final. To string generates a sensible, two string method instead of the memory address. And equals and hash code automatically generates both the equals and hash code methods which are frequently overwritten by Java developers. And lastly you have the one ring to rule them all at data which includes a bunch of them together. Longbuck works by modifying Java's abstract syntax tree during compilation injecting methods like getters, setters, and constructors before the byte code is generated. So once it's compiled it says if the developer wrote the code manually. This has been Longbuck in 60 seconds.
